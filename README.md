###### Weekly Payroll Project has built-in a python code and data analysis. All comments, and its structural format inside the __Payroll_data.ipynb__ is designed to walk you through step by step. Your journey will begin going from a nested dictionary all the way to the line graph, the histogram, and the summary of two methods of statistics with a Box-Whiskers Plot. The __payroll_tax_data.csv__ is also being used to project annual changes in the weekly payroll, and how it might affect totals for each year.
